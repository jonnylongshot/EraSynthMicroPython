# EraSynthMicroPython
This is a basic Python interface to the ERA Synth Micro made by [ERA Instruments] (https://erainstruments.com).
It has been developed and tested against firmware v1.0.7. 

Class methods implement a subset of the [serial port command list](https://github.com/erainstruments/erasynth-micro-docs/blob/master/erasynth-micro-command-list.pdf).

This code was written by Jonathan Horne and is free for use without restriction.
